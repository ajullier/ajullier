# What do we believe?
We recognize that time is our most valuable resource. Therefore, we concentrate on developing solutions that enable us to save, extends, and maximize our most prized possession: **TIME**.‚Äù ‚è∞

## Vision
We imagine a world without stressfull or repetitive jobs, where people have the freedom to pursue sports, arts, spend time with family, explore spirituality, and engage in scientific inquiry. It‚Äôs a future where our well-being is prioritized, allowing us to thrive in all aspects of life.

## Values
### Continous Improvement
We embrace candid feedback. Praise strengths, seek improvement. Three questions guide us: What to continue? What to stop? What to start?

### Honesty
We speak the truth even when it‚Äôs uncomfortable, and avoid deception or misleading others. It builds trust, fosters healthy relationships, and contributes to personal and societal well-being.

### Saying No
Not everything others ask or suggest aligns with our values and goals. We know how to say NO.

### Traditional Values and Family
Family is our society‚Äôs bedrock. Birth rates decline, but we value continuity.

Woke culture? We stand against it.

### Meritocracy
We don¬¥t care who you are or where you came from. If you are aligned with our believes, mision and values, you are welcome to be part of us.

### Keep it Simple

Whether in design, communication, or problem-solving, simplicity ensures better understanding and user acceptance. Avoid any unnecesary complexity.

### Standarization

We create clarity, standardize processes, and unleash innovation. Our unique documentation guides us to brilliance.

### Continous Learning

Seeking knowledge is both a spiritual obligation and a way to enhance society.

### Pursuing Our Passions 

We want every person who comes into contact with us to pursue their passion in life. Life is too short to dedicate it to what we don't like.

### Serene Work Enviroment

Minimize noise, optimize lighting, stay organized, prioritize ergonomics, and create rest zones. Working under pressure is not in our dictionary.

### Non Sustainable Development

We consider human activity to be inherently polluting, and setting short-term sustainable development goals is not a priority for us.üåøüåé

Nevertheless, we believe that all our activities should remain simple, highly efficient, and use minimal resources. Technological progress plays a crucial role in this.

- Eliminating unnecessary tasks.
- Prioritizing health to maximize our time.
- Making the most of every moment. ‚ÄòKilling time‚Äô ‚è≥ isn‚Äôt in our vocabulary; we‚Äôre committed to becoming our best selves.
